Readme

The purpose of this project is to create a professional README generator with all general components. I decided to do this project after learning the importance of README file in developersâ€™ world. It is a guide that gives users a detailed description of a particular project with instructions on how to install and run the project. I learned that writing a README file is not as  straightforward as it sounds. It requires some consideration and effort to make it legit and useful for readers.
