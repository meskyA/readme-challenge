### Description)
The purpose of this project is to create a professional README generator with all general components. I decided to do this project after learning the importance of README file in developers’ world. It is a guide that gives users a detailed description of a particular project with instructions on how to install and run the project. I learned that writing a README file is not as  straightforward as it sounds. It requires some consideration and effort to make it legit and useful for readers.

In order to install the necessary dependencies, open the console and run the following:
```npm install```


### Usage
Need to git clone and install node js on your computer. Also, json package or package-lock need to be installed in the terminal by using the command npm init.   

### Contributing
To contribute to a repo, create a personal fork of the project on Github by clicking the ‘fork’ button. Then clone the fork on local computer using the terminal and add the original repo as a remote called upstream.

### Test
In order to test, open the console and run the following
```npm test```
